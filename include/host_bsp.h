 * @brief All BSP core functions for the ARM host processor.
 *
 * This file contains all BSP core functions for the ARM host processor.
 *
 * ## BSP Message Passing
 *
 * See e_bsp.h for more information about BSP message passing.
 * The following information is specific for sending messages between the
 * host and Epiphany processor.
 *
 * The functions listed below can be used to send messages to message queue
 * of the programs for initialization and retrieve messages to gather results.
 *
 * The initialization messages will only remain in the queue until bsp_sync()
 * has been called for the first time by the Epiphany program.
 *
 * The default tagsize is zero.
 *
 * Sending messages must be done after bsp_init()
 * Retrieving messages must be done before bsp_end()
 *
 * - ebsp_set_tagsize()
 * - ebsp_send_down()
 * - ebsp_get_tagsize()
 * - ebsp_qsize()
 * - ebsp_get_tag()
 * - ebsp_move()
 * - ebsp_hpmove()
