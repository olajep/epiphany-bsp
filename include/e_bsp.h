 * @brief All BSP core functions for the Epiphany cores.
 *
 * This file contains all BSP core functions.
 *
 * ## BSP Message Passing functions
 * Every message contains a fixed-length (can change per superstep)
 * tag and a variable-length payload.
 * Default tag-size is zero unless the host has sent messages
 * and used ebsp_set_tagsize.
 * Note that the order of receiving messages is not guaranteed to correspond
 * to the order in which they were sent.
 *
 * Before the first sync, the queue contains messages from the ARM host
 * They are invalidated after the first call to bsp_sync().

 * The DMA (`E_DMA_1`) will be started if it was not started yet.
 * If it was already started, this task will be pushed to a queue so that it
 * will be done some time later. Use ebsp_dma_wait() to wait for the task to
 * complete.
 *
 * Usage example:
 * \code{.c}
 * int s = bsp_pid();
 * int p = bsp_nprocs();
 * 
 * // Data to be sent
 * float mydata[16];

 * // Buffer to receive data
 * float incomingdata[16];

 * // Register it in the BSP system
 * bsp_push_reg(&incomingdata, sizeof(incomingdata));
 * bsp_sync();
 * 
 * // Get an address for the incomingdata buffer on the core with pid s + 1.
 * float* remotedata = ebsp_get_direct_address((s+1)%p, &incomingdata);
 * 
 * // Start the DMA to copy the data from mydata on this core to incomingdata on the next core
 * ebsp_dma_handle descriptor;
 * ebsp_dma_push(&descriptor, remotedata, &mydata, sizeof(mydata));
 * 
 * // Do lengthy computation
 * do_computations();
 * 
 * // Wait for the DMA transfer to finish
 * ebsp_dma_wait(&descriptor);
 * 
 * // Done
 * \endcode

 * @remarks
 * The `desc` pointer should be 8-byte aligned or behaviour is undefined.
 * This should not be a problem because the malloc functions always return
 * 8-byte aligned pointers, and having an `ebsp_dma_handle` struct as
 * local variable will be 8-byte aligned as well.
